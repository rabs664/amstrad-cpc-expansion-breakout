# amstrad-cpc-expansion-breakout
Simple PCB with labels and header pins for the Amstrad CPC Expansion Bus, compatible with an MX4 connector.

Allows Amstrad CPC Expansion bus signals to be monitored using the labels without having to remember the pin position on the connector.

Source contains Eagle schematic, board and cam output (gerber) files.

Note there is no ESD protection and the headers connect directly to the expansion bus, so care should be taken at all times to prevent accidents.

see Wiki for more info.
